Diving into server-side Swift can seem straightforward at first if one knows the programming language, but it might be harder than you think since it involves developing on a new platform. I will walk you through my journey coming from iOS into Vapor, what challenges I faced, and which strengths I had coming from the iOS platform. I will talk about how these challenges can be overcome and I will share my experiences after working with Vapor in production for 6 months.

## Key takeaways
- What server-side Swift and the Vapor framework is
- What challenges you might face coming from an iOS background into server-side Swift and how to overcome these
- How I have been working with server-side Swift in production for 6 months
- Why I think Vapor is production ready
