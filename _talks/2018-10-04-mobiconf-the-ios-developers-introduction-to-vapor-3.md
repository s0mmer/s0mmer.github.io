Server-side Swift has been around for a couple of years and as time goes by the maturity of putting Swift on the server grows. With this talk, I will give an introduction to one of the most popular server-side Swift frameworks called Vapor, which recently released a new major version. I will talk a bit about how I ended up doing server-side Swift development after working with iOS for years and Iâ€™ll look at the potential synergy between Vapor and iOS. This talk requires no prior knowledge to server-side Swift.
