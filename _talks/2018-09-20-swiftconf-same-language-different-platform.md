Being able to share code between an iOS app and a backend running server-side Swift was one of the first things I thought about when Swift went open source. It’s been a common argument for choosing a server-side Swift framework ever since, although there’s been little focus on what is actually possible. With this talk I will dive into the current possibilities and limitations for sharing code between iOS and Vapor and I will look ahead and discus how this might change in the future.
