Since I started working with [ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa){:target="_blank"} (2.x) I've been following the upcoming [Swift version](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa/tree/swift-development){:target="_blank"}, or ReactiveCocoa 3.0, closely. When it hit beta-4, I thought it was time to finally try it out. I decided to make a simple one-view-app that displays the today's menu at my work.

The app is currently focused around ReactiveCocoa 4.0, MVVM, Swift 2 and watchOS 2 but it also explores other frameworks/tools.

The app uses a small backend I developed in Rails. I [open sourced the app on GitHub](https://github.com/steffendsommer/TodaysReactiveMenu){:target="_blank"} and my plan is to continue to explore ReactiveCocoa as the framework progresses.
