Since I started working with [ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa){:target="_blank"} (2.x) I've been following the upcoming [Swift version](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa/tree/swift-development){:target="_blank"}, or ReactiveCocoa 3.0, closely. When it hit beta-4, I thought it was time to finally try it out. I decided to make a simple one-view-app that displays the today's menu at my work.

The app is mainly focused around ReactiveCocoa 3.0, Swift and MVVM but it also explores other frameworks/tools including:

- [ObjectMapper](https://github.com/Hearst-DD/ObjectMapper){:target="_blank"}
- [PureLayout](https://github.com/smileyborg/PureLayout){:target="_blank"}
- [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage){:target="_blank"}

The app uses a small backend I developed in Rails. I [open sourced the app on GitHub](https://github.com/s0mmer/TodaysReactiveMenu){:target="_blank"} and my plan is to continue to explore ReactiveCocoa 3.0 as the framework progresses.
