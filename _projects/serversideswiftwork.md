After noticing how challenging it can be to find the right people within the small (but growing) server-side Swift space, I figured that it made sense to have a specialized jobs/work site. The site allows people to post jobs/work related to server-side Swift and it allows interested candidates to sign up to get the posted jobs in their mailbox once a week.
