Swift iOS programming for Kids (published by PACKT) is my first book which I wrote together with Jim Campagno, an iOS developer from New York, US. The book targets kids with no prior programming experience and takes them from no experience to developing their first iOS application. My main motivation for saying yes to the project, were to try and contribute to make Swift more accessible, but also to become a better writer in general.
