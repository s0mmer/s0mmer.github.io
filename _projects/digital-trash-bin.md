Vipp wanted a digital version of their world-famous trash bin. After the trash bin had been designed in a digital format by another designer, I developed a small application for both OSX and Windows. The application simply replaced the built-in trash bin in the OS with the Vipp Digital Trash Bin.

The app was the first of its kind and was rewarded with a Gold Award at the Creative Circle Awards. Further, did the app got downloaded thousands of times and received coverage from multiple well-known blogs, such as Hypebeast.
