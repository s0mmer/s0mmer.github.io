In a busy week, it can be hard to take time off to work on your own small software projects. The idea behind BITWKND was to encourage people to allocate time for networking, talking tech ideas and to actually spend time on developing the projects you never have the time for developing. I designed and developed the one page website using Flat UI for Bootstrap and Jade. Mailchimp was used for handling the newsletter and the invite list.

BITWKND has been held once with great success and I am right now considering whether or not I have the time to plan a new event.
