I got the idea of building a platform for mobile payments using an approach as Podio uses for project management. A flexible platform which makes it easy for bars, cinemas, cafe's and many more to setup mobile payments. With a clear and cheap price model and with easy integration into existing POS systems, KOE was intended to scale quickly.

The plan was to crowdfund the project using Kickstarter in order to be able to allocate time for the project. I planned the project together with my thesis partner, but because we were caught up with other projects and our thesis, the project never left the concept stage, nor did it get posted on Kickstarter.

I still see the value in this idea, but a lot of competitors is entering the market, so it seems unlikely that I will pick up this project again.
