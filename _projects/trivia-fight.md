Trivia Fight is a quiz application developed for the iPhone. I joined the project while Trivia Fight was only an idea and I've had influence on the final concept. Besides that, I planned the technical foundation and lead the development of Trivia Fight. I have done all of the iOS development solely, with the interface being designed by another company. Trivia Fight was originally hosted using Heroku, but is hosted today using AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

Trivia Fight was launched in the US and later in Denmark. The application has over 20.000 users and thousands of active users every month. The application has been mentioned in several of the biggest Danish publications including Metroxpress, SÃ¸ndagsavisen, Euroman, BT, Ekstra Bladet and more.

The app can be downloaded at the App Store [here](https://itunes.apple.com/dk/app/trivia-fight-gratis-dansk/id671858808?mt=8){:target="_blank"}.
