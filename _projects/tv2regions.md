TV 2 is a government-owned subscription television station in Denmark and the TV 2 Regions is a group of 8 independent companies that focuses on news within their own region.

The TV 2 Regions Play apps (currently launched for two of the eight regions) is an app that allows users to stream any content offered by their region. I helped build a backend solution for this app which synchronizes content with TV 2's content system. It offers an admin panel for TV 2 Region administrators to manage some of the app-specific content and it exposes a modern API for the iOS and Android apps to integrate with.
