PwC is a multinational professional services network and is one the Big Four auditors. PwC wanted an app for their customers to stay on top of content and offers that PwC has to offer.

I helped build a backend solution for this app which synchronizes content with PwC's own system. It offers an admin panel for PwC administrators to manage some of the app-specific content and it has a modern API for the iOS and Android apps to interface.
