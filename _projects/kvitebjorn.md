Kvitebjørn is a district heating network in Tromso (Norway) and the Kvitebjørn app is an internal tool we built for the owners to keep track of the key metrics for the facility. I helped build a middleware that handles incoming data from the facility and exposes a modern API for the iOS app to consume.
