I helped start the first London based Vapor meetup which I also help organize today. The meetup is usually held every month, with different companies in London hosting the meetup. Each event consists of 2-3 talks as well as time for networking. The events has around 20-50 participants each time and I try to give a talk once in a while.

After running VaporLondon for awhile we reached out to VaporBerlin to try and organize the meetups together using the same format while helping other people start new meetups in other cities.
