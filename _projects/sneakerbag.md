SNEAKERBAG is an app for the iPhone which eases the task of selling, buying and trading sneakers. The app has a Tinder-inspired "exploring view" where one can easily swipe through all the sneakers in the database.

The app is designed using Sketch and is being built using Parse as a backend. The UI is done programatically using a couple of pods for convenience, such as Masonry. I also used Liftoff (a wonderful tool from thoughtbot) for the first time for this project. The app is far from done and most of the app is still on idea-basis.
