For launching the new flavour "Apple Bite" from Smirnoff, Mintcph was asked to help promoting this flavour. I helped Mintcph in designing and developing a Facebook app. The idea behind the campaign was pretty straightforward: during events at clubs, bars etc. people would receive stickers with 5-digit codes which they could submit at applebite.dk in order to participate in the competition. In order to submit their code, people were asked to like the Smirnoff page first. For storing the submitted codes with references to the specific Facebook profiles, Parse was used as a backend.
