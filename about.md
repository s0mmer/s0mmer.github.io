Hi! I am Steffen D. Sommer and I am a passionate and ambitious Swift developer with a flair for design from Copenhagen, Denmark. I have a master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Copenhagen, and I have multiple years of experience working with apps of high complexity and large user bases. 

I favor software that is consistent, decoupled, tested and easy to reason about. I care and contribute to the Swift community in order to improve as a community as well as progressing as an individual. I like to be proactive, I love experimenting, I'm interested in UX and UI's and I'm not a fan of the saying "If it ain't broke, don't fix it". 

After doing years of iOS development, I made the switch to the server where I am now doing fulltime server-side development using Vapor.

When I'm not writing software I'm probably socialising, travelling the world or doing triathlon (2014 Ironman). I'm also a big fan of boards üèÑ üèÇ.

My CV is available [here](/cv){:target="_blank"}, on [LinkedIn](http://dk.linkedin.com/pub/steffen-d-sommer/21/8b0/726/){:target="_blank"} and on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/cv/steffendsommer){:target="_blank"}. I am currently employed at [Nodes](https://www.nodesagency.com/){:target="_blank"}.
