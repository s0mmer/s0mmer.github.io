Hi! I am a passionate and ambitious Swift developer with management experience and a flair for design and UX from Copenhagen, Denmark. I have a master's degree in Computer Science as well as experience working with apps and backends of high complexity and large user bases. Further, I have experience being a technically lead as well as being a manager. 

I favor software that is consistent, decoupled, tested and easy to reason about. I care and contribute to the community in order to improve as a community as well as progressing as an individual. I like to be proactive, I love experimenting, I'm interested in UX and UI's and I'm not a fan of the saying "If it ain't broke, don't fix it". 

After doing years of iOS development, I made the switch to the server where I am now doing fulltime server-side Swift development using Vapor.

When I'm not writing software I'm probably traveling the world 🌍 or having fun on a board 🏄 🏂.
