Hi! I am Steffen D. Sommer and I am a passionate and ambitious iOS developer with a flair for design from Copenhagen, Denmark. I have a master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Copenhagen, and I have multiple years of experience working with apps of high complexity and large user bases. 

I favor software that is consistent, decoupled, tested and easy to reason about. I care and contribute to the iOS community in order to improve as a community as well as progressing as an individual. I like to be proactive, I love experimenting, I'm interested in UX and UI's and I'm not a fan of the saying "If it ain't broke, don't fix it". 

My current focus within iOS development is on Swift, VIPER, SOLID, TDD, POP and FRP.

When I'm not writing software I'm probably socialising, travelling the world or doing triathlon (2014 Ironman). I'm also a big fan of boards üèÑ üèÇ.

My CV is available [here](/cv){:target="_blank"}, on [LinkedIn](http://dk.linkedin.com/pub/steffen-d-sommer/21/8b0/726/){:target="_blank"} and on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/cv/steffendsommer){:target="_blank"}. I am currently employed at [Unwire](http://unwire.com){:target="_blank"}.
