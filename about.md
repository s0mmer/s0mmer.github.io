Hi! I am Steffen D. Sommer and I am an iOS developer with a flair for design from Copenhagen, Denmark. I have a master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Copenhagen, and my studies includes a specialisation in Application Development and a semester in San Diego, California.

My strongest competencies is within web and mobile and I put great value in details while being passionate about UX and beautiful UI's. I like to be proactive, I love experimenting and I'm not a big fan of the saying "If it ain't broke, don't fix it".

My current focus within iOS development is on functional reactive programming using ReactiveCocoa and MVVM. Going forward I would like to work more with Swift and functional programming.

Besides crafting iOS apps, I do triathlon and in the summer of 2014 I completed my first Ironman. I also enjoy socialising, playing soccer, exploring the world and reading/learning about management and startups.

I am currently employed at [Unwire](http://unwire.com).
