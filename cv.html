<p class="summary">
    I am a passionate and ambitious Swift developer with a flair for design from Copenhagen, Denmark. I have a master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Copenhagen, and I have multiple years of experience working with apps of high complexity and large user bases.
    <br><br>
    I favor software that is consistent, decoupled, tested and easy to reason about. I care and contribute to the Swift community in order to improve as a community as well as progressing as an individual. I like to be proactive, I love experimenting, I'm interested in UX and UI's and I'm not a fan of the saying "If it ain't broke, don't fix it". 
    <br><br>
    After doing years of iOS development, I made the switch to the server where I am now doing fulltime server-side Swift development using Vapor.
