<p class="summary">
    I am a passionate and ambitious iOS developer with a flair for design from Copenhagen, Denmark. 
    I have a master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Copenhagen, and I have multiple years of experience working with apps of high complexity and large user bases. 
    I favor software that is consistent, decoupled, tested and easy to reason about.
    I care and contribute to the iOS community in order to improve as a community as well as progressing as an individual.
    I like to be proactive, I love experimenting, I'm interested in UX and UI's and I'm not a fan of the saying "If it ain't broke, don't fix it". </br>

<h2><a href="http://www.unwire.com" target="_blank">Unwire</a></h2>
<h3>Senior iOS Developer</h3>
<h4>February 2016 – Present - Copenhagen, Denmark</h4>
<p>At Unwire I have helped developing some of the biggest payment applications in Denmark. I have been involved in the development projects from initial planning and estimation to customer workshops and design phase to carrying out the actual implementation. Finally I have been involved in continously releasing new updates in collaboration with other platform teams as well as the customer. At Unwire I've been very active in advocating strong coding practices as well as trying to ensure a high level of knowledge sharing. Lastly I have tried to introduce cutting edge technologies and tried to make Unwire a bigger part of the iOS community, e.g. by organising iOS meetups at the office.</p>

<p>Along my master studies I joined the entrepreneur project, Trivia Fight, which is a quiz application developed for the iPhone. I joined the project at a very early stage and I had influence on the final concept and I was in charge of planning the technical foundation. Besides leading the development of Trivia Fight, I did all of the iOS development solely. Trivia Fight was launched in the US and later in Denmark. The application had over 20.000 users and thousands of active users every month. The application got mentioned in several of the biggest Danish publications, e.g. Metroxpress, Søndagsavisen, Euroman, BT, Ekstra Bladet and more.</p>
