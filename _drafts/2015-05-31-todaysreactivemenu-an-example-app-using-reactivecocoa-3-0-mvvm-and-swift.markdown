I've been working with ReactiveCocoa the last 8 months and I'm overall very satisfied with the framework and the approach in general. I've been following the progress on ReactiveCocoa 3.0 (mainly focused around Swift) and when it recently hit beta-4, I decided to dig in.

First of all, I want to put out a disclaimer. I'm new to Swift and I'm definitely new to RAC 3.0. Because of that, the majority of the hours I put into making this app, I felt like I had no idea of what I was doing:

Also, it's worth noting that the intention of this project and blog post is just to get any interested reader kickstarted with ReactiveCocoa 3.0. It is not an introduction to ReactiveCocoa or MVVM.

# Other useful resources
ReactiveCocoa 3.0 is, at the time of writing, still very new and because of that, the resources are limited. I also know that this post is jumping straight into the bits and pieces of the app instead of explaining the concepts of ReactiveCocoa 3.0. If you're looking for other resources, here are some I used while creating this project:
