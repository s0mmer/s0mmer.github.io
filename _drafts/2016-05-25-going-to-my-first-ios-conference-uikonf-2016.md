# Day 1: Social events

![A small stop on UIKonf bike tour](/assets/posts/social_01.jpg)

I signed up for the UIKonf Bike Tour because I remembered seeing some awesome pictures from the event on Twitter last year. Also, I thought it would be a great opportunity to see the city, being a bit active, and hopefully being outside in great weather.

After meeting up at 2pm and getting our bikes we started biking through the city as one huge group (30 ish?). [@olebegemann](https://twitter.com/olebegemann) was our tour guide and he had several helpers to make sure everybody kept biking together and got safe around the city. I had my doubts about how well it would work with such a big group, but it turned out just fine.

I've been to Berlin several times and I felt like I've seen the most "must-sees" as a tourist, but I was wrong. During the 5 hour-ish ride, we saw some pretty interesting places. One of my favourite spots of the day were the closed airport Berlin Tempelhof Airport which was one big playground for sports, creativity and joy. Overall I would say that biking around in 25 degrees and surrounded by nice and friendly people was simply just great. We ended up biking almost 25km and here is the route we took:

We ended our bike tour at a restaurant with a very nice location close to a canal. It was a great opportunity to reflect on the day with the other participants as well as getting to know them even more. Oh ye, and of course drinking a cold üç∫ We ended the day by meeting with the people from all of the other social events at a pretty cool place called InFarm. Here we were able to check in and grab some free drinks before heading tired and satisfied back to the hotel.

# Day 2: First day with talks

After waking up with sore legs and a slight sunburn I was super excited for the actual first day with talks at UIKonf. After arriving at the beautiful venue and grabbing a delicious coffee from Companion Coffee, the talks began. Here are my top picks from the first day with talks:

## Jeff Watkins - Legacy

The day started with [Jeff Watkins](https://twitter.com/jeffwatkins) talking about legacy. Not as in legacy code, but as in, the legacy we leave behind when we pass on. I watch a lot of videos from iOS conferences around the world and I always think that it is refreshing to hear talks that is related to our field, but without being super technical. Jeff talked a lot about how we together as a community can contribute to a better future. He touched subjects such as race and gender discrimination and how important it is to expand our community. Definitely a lot of food for thought and a talk that must have required some courage to pull off. Lots of kudos!


## Steve Scott - MVVM-C In Practice

I've being working with the MVVM pattern for the last 1-2 years and I totally related to the problem [Steve Scott](https://twitter.com/macdevnet) were trying to solve using a slightly modified pattern called MVVM-C. The C in MVVM-C stands for Coordinator which tries to take the responsibility of navigation. The talk was very practical and I believe it is a great starting point for apps that is architectured using MVVM. I will personally revisit the video of the talk and try to incorporate his ideas into my thinking of MVVM.


## Ellen Shapiro - Outside In - Using UI Tests To Start Improving Your App

![Ellen Shapiro on stage](/assets/posts/conf_04.jpg)

UI testing is fairly new to me, and it is an area I've wanted to dive in for some time, but I haven't quite taken the jump yet. Since Xcode 7 introduced XCUI I've always just assumed that, that was the tool I were going to use. However, it was quite interesting to hear about [Ellen Shapiro](https://twitter.com/designatednerd)'s experience when doing UI testing. In particular I found her comparison between KIF and XCUI because I was totally unaware of the pro's and con's between these tools. Also, I felt that her experience with these tools would make a great starting point for me to start doing UI testing in the apps I work on.

All in all a great day with great talks, awesome coffee (and ice cream), lots of friendly people and more sunny weather ‚òÄÔ∏è
