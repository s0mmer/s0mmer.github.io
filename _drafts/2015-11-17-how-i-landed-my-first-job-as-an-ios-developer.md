## How I landed my first job as an iOS developer

I recently got contacted by my old university, University of Copenhagen, where I got my master's degree in Computer Science about 1.5 years ago. They contacted me to ask if I would be interested in giving a talk at the university about my career. The purpose of the event was to inspire the new master's students in their studies. I accepted this offer as I thought it sounded interesting, and also because I saw it as a good way to give back to the university. To kickstart the presentation I'm writing this blog post as I believe it will help me get my mind going, but also to share experience when deciding on a career to any interested reader. Lastly I've also wanted to take time off to reflect more about the whole education to job transition and this seemed as a great opportunity.

# M.Sc. Computer Science
Introduce my degrees.

# Job related experience
Introduce my part time jobs.

# My first iOS developer position at Unwire
Explain how I landed my first job and how it has been.

# My future career
Perhaps some small writings about my thoughts on the future.
