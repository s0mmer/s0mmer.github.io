Back in 2015 I blogged about how I landed my first job as an iOS developer.
After doing around 3 years of fulltime iOS development I decided to make a
career switch. Instead of focusing on mobile development, I started to focus
on backend development. The most exciting part of this switch was that I was
able to continue using the programming language I had become so passionate
about. 10 months has passed and I'm now trying to look back at what I have
learned from making this switch.
