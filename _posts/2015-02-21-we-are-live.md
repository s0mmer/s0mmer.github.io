After been working as a full-time iOS developer for approximately 7 months, I figured it was time for me to start sharing my experiences and knowledge as I progress.

I am currently working with, and trying to find best practices using, ReactiveCocoa and MVVM. Going forward I plan to dive more into Swift while also practicing functional programming more. Lastly, I want to be better at doing testing in iOS and perhaps try to change my mindset as a developer towards something as BDD. 

My intention is to try and simplify my findings along the way and I encourage any reader to reach out if you have any question or general feedback. Welcome to my blog.
